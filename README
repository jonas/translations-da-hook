Until the first version of the Danish translation file gets merged,
two changes needs to be made to Liferay in order to use this hook.

 1. First, you need to add da_DK to the locales property in your
    portal-ext.properties. For example:

	locales=en_GB,fr_FR,da_DK

 2. Optionally, you should define a Danish I18n servlet mapping, somewhere
    Liferay's web.xml file:

	<servlet-mapping>
		<servlet-name>I18n Servlet</servlet-name>
		<url-pattern>/da/*</url-pattern>
	</servlet-mapping>
